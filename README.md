<br/>To use this webpage, you must fist click the red "Generate Password" button. Then, you will be asked five prompts: the amount of characters in your password (must be a number higher than 8 and lower than 128) and whether you want special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and/or uppercase letters within your password. Once you've completed all the prompts, your randomly-generated password will appear in the box that reads "Your secure password" for you to copy and paste. To generate a new password, you must refresh the page and follow the steps again.

<br/>If you'd like to view your answers to the prompts, consult the console section in DevTools.
